              <h2>Flow</h2>
              <p>
                I will start this one with the word routine. We all might have
                come across this term routine and tried to make one and
                implement it. Why? Because we have been told that without a
                routine you are a man without a direction.It's true i agree that
                the most of the successful people in this world live a routine
                life,and even i wish to get a one fixed.But what about the
                people who don't have a one or who go with the flow ,or have a
                flexible routine.Are they worthless ? Can't they achieve much?I
                mean i really don't think they can't they definitely can achieve
                much.The problem is we have been sold a dream a dream attached
                with the term routine,wake up at 4am ,get done x in y time ,get
                done another thing a in b time and blah blah but the truth is
                that,not every thing in your life runs according to you
                always,thus your so called ideal routine breaks and you get
                disspaointed.As far as i think sometimes we just need to go with
                the flow ,flexibility should be brought into life ,sometime we
                need not think too much in our life instead get things done
                ,that's it.Let me give you quick example of girl i met few days
                back ,well being an introverted it's difficult for me to put a
                convo on, but if i find people more like me,it's easy for me
                .When i talked her she showed as she is a person who hasn't
                achieve much in her life,but the truth isn't like that,when i
                checked out her drawings ,it's was awesome ,it really is.By
                reading her blogs i got to know that she has underestimated
                herself too much.As if she is nothing.But it's not true.So what
                I want to point out of it is ,there are people who get done
                things in the flow more than people do in a fixed hard routine.
                And this counterintuitive approach to live life reduces stress
                like hell.I am'nt saying that leave your routine.But don't get
                stressed if your routine is not working out ,if you are not an
                early bird.Just go with the flow buddy. Find balance for you.
               <br> Special thanks to the girl I met.</br>

              <h2>Moving On</h2>
              <p>
                Have you ever wondered what is correct? Moving on or Moved on?
                Well, both are correct in their own places. But what I have
                observed when I come across people is that they don't
                differentiate it well, often confusing the meaning. I have
                talked to many people who have gone through a breakup, and they
                often find themselves with a bunch of questions in their minds:
                Why am I not able to move on? Why do those memories come back
                again? Why do I feel compassion for the person who treated me
                badly? For those individuals, I would like to address the fact
                that the pain of breakups is the worst kind of pain you will
                ever experience. It is loaded with different kinds of emotions.
                If you, the person reading this, have gone through it or are
                going through it, God gives you the power and strength to bear
                and overcome that pain. It's not an easy process to come out of
                it; it's moving on when you have experienced such a tragedy.
                It's not like you can perform a trick with a magic wand and
                instantly move on. It's a process, and the overcoming period
                varies from person to person! If you have decided to move on,
                take it slow and steady. Those thoughts, memories, and emotions
                will still come up during the process. It's not about trying to
                suppress those thoughts, but rather letting them come and go,
                not dwelling on them. It's not about forgetting those memories
                entirely, but focusing on the good ones and learning lessons
                from the bad ones. It's not about suppressing your emotions, but
                allowing them to flow out in front of the people you trust. So,
                once you go through the process, and those things don't disturb
                you anymore, you have moved on. Keep in mind that when you are
                in such a state, your mind isn't always logical; there is
                emotional inflammation in certain parts of your brain. So,
                please seek help if needed, either from a doctor, friends, or
                family—don't hesitate. Show some strength; you can get yourself
                out of it. People can assist you through the process of
                achieving your goal, but you need to take the first steps and
                have the conviction to get there. Remember this quote I follow:
                "I will do what i can , Rest I leave to God." Good luck! It's
                going to be okay!

              <h2>Cooking with Compassion and Perspective</h2>
              <p>
                Today, I've got a cooking story to share. So, yesterday, I was
                starving, and I headed to the kitchen to find something to eat.
                My mom wasn't home, and guess what I found? A complete mess!
                Dirty dishes piled up, plates scattered all over, and jars in
                disarray – probably the aftermath of some guests visiting. I was
                so damn frustrated, and my hunger made it even worse. I was
                like, "Why the heck is the kitchen in this state? And why is
                there nothing to eat?" But then, I tried to think rationally. I
                put myself in my mom's shoes – imagine dealing with all this
                chaos and still managing to cook and clean up regularly. Damn,
                it must be tough! Suddenly, my anger turned into empathy for my
                mom's hard work. Feeling guilty about the mess, I decided to do
                something about it. I cleaned the entire kitchen – washed over
                20 utensils, scrubbed those dishes, and yeah, the floor too! Let
                me tell you, it's way more challenging than I thought,
                especially since I'm a guy, and society has this messed up
                mentality that guys shouldn't do household stuff. Screw that!
                I'm helping my mom, no matter what they say. Now, back to my
                hunger. I thought, "Why not cook something?" And then it hit me
                – I remembered a recipe from my hostel days when I was just a
                kid. I had to dig deep into my memory and recreate that damn
                paneer dish I used to sneak a peek at when the hostel kitchen
                smelled amazing. So, I gathered all the ingredients and started
                cooking. It was like a flashback to those old days. The kitchen
                filled with nostalgia, and I felt connected to my past self.
                Finally, I plated up the dish, and just when I thought I was
                gonna mess it up, my mom arrived home. We tasted the food
                together, and guess what? My mom said it was even better than
                her cooking! Damn, that felt so good – like I achieved something
                big. This whole experience taught me something valuable. Before
                getting mad or frustrated, try seeing things from the other
                person's perspective. I get it now, and it's all about
                understanding and appreciating the hard work someone else puts
                in. And let me tell you, cooking and cleaning ain't no joke! So
                yeah, that's my cooking adventure and the lesson I learned – a
                little empathy can change everything. Now, who's up for some
                delicious homemade paneer? I got you covered!

              <h2>Love</h2>
              <p>
                Love, the most trending topic all around.Or you better say true
                love what people term it as .Very honestly for me it is one of
                those topic which makes me feel that ,quantum mechanics is
                easier.But at the same time i can speak on the topic for whole
                the day. Few people say it ,its the most beautiful feelings you
                will ever experience,some say it makes you feel butterfly in the
                stomach,or some say it like a magic. But the question arises is
                that why doesn't these feelings about someone last long,why it
                vanishes? Is the end of feelings towards someone is the end of
                the relationship? Okay lets start with answering the first one
                ,i do agree with all the peoples definiton about love,they want
                to convey the same things but in different ways,if we look into
                the physoclogical aspect of its nothing but you just had the
                happy chemicals for the moment and then you get attached.For
                someone it might be attractions of appearance ,for someone it
                might be attraction of thought process,for someone attractions
                of charactersitic/behaviour of the person.You just start liking
                any aspect of the person or many aspects of the person. The
                seocnd question's answer is so dam related to the first one,
                like okay fine you had those feelings ,what next?One should rely
                untill the feelings exist?No,definitely not ,nothing in this
                world is constant,not even a single thing,change is the only
                constant.So one shouldn't rely on the feelings to keep a
                relatioship.Instead one should rely on respect towards each
                other,the trust towards each other,the understanding towards
                each other,these won't vansihes away quickly because these have
                build over time,these aren't just feelings but practises.
                'Respect for each other is most important'

              <h2>Glow Up</h2>
              <p>
                Glow up? I mean I was really thinking about it, when we look in
                our old pictures and compare it with the new one we feel like we
                have glow up a lot, we look better, yeah that's true but It's
                that the complete glow up? Isn't it obvious that our physical
                appearance changes over time and with evolution of AI the photos
                get better. But what remains almost static is our mental growth,
                which doesn't enhance without effort, it requires efforts and
                hard work. So the complete glow should be, glow up by physical
                appearance, (not necessary in all the cases) and glow and grow
                up of brain, which is necessary. At the end of the day you get
                paid for what you have inside your head, and how differently you

              <h2>Hustle Culture</h2>
              <p>
                Hustle culture, this is also among the most hottest keyword
                around internet.Hustle for me like is working hard and harder
                for your dreams.But what the issue is nowdays the hustle culture
                has become toxic hustle culture.By toxic hustle culture i mean
                is people are promoted to leave everything and work,lock their
                self into the rooms ,this that and shit .What i want to point
                out of this post is its not bad to work hard on your dreams, but
                it is really bad to fall in the toxic social media hustle
                culture.Do hustle for your dreams but don't forget to live in
                between ,don't forget to cherish your memories,don't leave your
                friends and family don't let go the relatiohips you have in the
                hustle period of your life.At the end you need your people to
                cherish your achievements.

              <h2>Street Dogs</h2>
              <p>
                Whenever I see street dogs around me, my mind always pops the
                thoughts of the way Mr Shantanu Naidu, yes that young guy whom
                you see with Mr Ratan Tata often.He created a belt for street
                dogs,that can be worn around their neck so that in night
                whenever lights fall on them,those belts reflect the light
                back.This initiative by him reduced the road accidents of street
                dogs in mass number.The lesson i want to point out from this
                post is that when you really want to help,the idea automatically
                pops out and like human beings the animals got soul in them
                too,so please its humble request that whenever you get a chance
                to help the street dogs around you don't hesitate.Even a biscuit
                could help them reduce their hunger.Thanks from the bottom of my
                heart❤️

            <p>
              Hello, I'm Aman Sharma, a passionate writer and poet. I have a
              deep love for exploring a wide range of topics and sharing my
              unique perspectives and views through my writing. Writing, to me,
              is an art, and I strive to find beauty in everything I encounter.
            </p>

            <p>
              My purpose in creating blogs is to add value to people's lives.
              Whether it's through thought-provoking articles, inspiring
              stories, or my poetic expressions, I aim to provide content that
              enriches the lives of my readers.
            </p>

            <p>
              I embarked on this blogging journey with a desire to connect with
              a diverse audience and engage in meaningful conversations. Over
              time, I've had the privilege of sharing my thoughts and ideas on a
              wide array of subjects.
            </p>

            <p>
              Beyond the world of prose, I am also a poet. I've poured my heart
              and soul into the art of poetry and have been fortunate enough to
              see my work come to life in my published book. Poetry allows me to
              explore the depths of human emotion and the intricacies of life in
              a unique and profound way.
            </p>

            <p>
              I see everything as art, a beautiful masterpiece waiting to be
              discovered. From the mundane to the extraordinary, there is art in
              every aspect of our lives. I invite you to join me in this
              artistic exploration, where we can find beauty in unexpected
              places.
            </p>

            <p>

              inspiration, enlightenment, and a renewed appreciation for the
